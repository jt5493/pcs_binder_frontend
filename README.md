# PCS Binder



## Description

It is called PCS (permanent change of station) Binder. It is a very simple yet useful application. For those that are not familiar with the military lifestyle, every couple of years military personnel are asked to pick up and move to a new location. Sometimes it could be in the States or on the other side of the world. Regardless of where your are moving to, it always comes with a ton of complications and a huge to-do list. For every move I have done I have always created a PCS Binder to try and keep track of all the documents and important information that comes pouring in. So I thought it would be nice to create a digital version where I could upload digital copies of everything and not worry about losing everything important and have access to it anywhere.
